This Q2 challenge was developed in VueJS. I was using basic HTTP Request in VueJS to solve the challenges. Also, I fix the misstype JSON data, where it should be articles, not articles:.
After get the data at url given, I use a JSON parse to convert it from string to object type.
I completed each number by using foreach looping and basic javascript algorithm. For the last challenge, I use datetime to compare between two date.
Thank you.
