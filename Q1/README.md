This Q1 challenge was developed in VueJS. I was using basic Javascript algorithm logic to solve the challenges, like substring, concat, etc.
Start with fill the inputs, there are restaurant name, datetime, cashier name, details of item and price, and also costs total.
After user completed fill the input, system will remove the form and output things that had been filled before.
I also limit the string to 30 characters, if more than it, the rest will print in new line and loop the while until its length less than 30.
Thank you.
