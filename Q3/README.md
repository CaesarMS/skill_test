This Q3 challenge was developed in VueJS. I was using basic HTTP Request in VueJS to solve the challenges.
After get the data at url given, I use a JSON parse to convert it from string to object type.
There is a little tricky in number 4 challenges. Where the dates are all in seconds format. So I do multiplication with 1000, then I got the exact dates.
Thank you.
